# Blogs by Uzair Afzal

This project, Blogs by Uzair Afzal, is carried out using Linux OS, Apache web server, MySQL relational database and PHP programming language (the LAMPP stack). The blogging system has fully functional front-end (for reading blogs), back-end (for managing users, comments, blogs, views, images and posts) and a third-party sign-up platform (to get access and write blogs with admin approval). To date, this is the largest project of its kind that I have made and managed all by myself

It took around 65 days of rigorous programming and debugging to create this project during summer vacation, 2020

Please be notified that I did not create the GUI by myself, not at all. Bootstrap template (Philosophy) was used for this purpose
